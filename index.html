<blockquote>
A User Interface is like a joke: if you have to explain it, it&#8217;s not that good.
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This guide exists because of limitations in the User Interface (UI) currently implemented in FarSight Studios' <em>The Pinball Arcade</em> (TPA) for Android. In its current form, the UI is limiting, it confuses customers, and offers an unsatisfactory User Experience (UX) for new and seasoned users alike.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Pinball Arcade Fans community and I have been working around issues caused by the UI for close to two years now, and the number of cases I&#8217;ve personally encountered where customers are just plain confused about features is getting to the point where I have no choice but to take action.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Users Guide contains information about features in TPA that can&#8217;t be adequately explained in-game because of a combination of UI limitations and/or the complexity of the feature.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A lot of things in this guide can be figured out by playing around with the UI: you might be comfortable doing this. If you aren&#8217;t comfortable doing this, you may be in for a rough ride: some features really aren&#8217;t intuitive, and some features may unpleasantly surprise you down the track if you don&#8217;t fully understand how they work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This guide is not a tool created to disrespect FarSight and their product. Quite the opposite: it is a factual testimonial from a customer who happens to be a volunteer beta tester and Technical Writer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TPA really is the only game in town if you want to play real pinball from the leading manufacturers. If the UI and UX can be fixed, then the game will continue to grow. I fear that if it doesn&#8217;t improve, the game will fall behind it&#8217;s competitors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I hope this guide helps you get the most out of the app.</p>

<h2 id="Settings_Menu"><a class="anchor" href="#Settings_Menu"></a>2. The Settings Menu Explained</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>User Interface limitations caused the Settings menu to evolve from a pretty terse list of items, to what is is now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are some options that use Developer speak and would be meaningless to many users, yet are very important for configuring optimum performance in Android for older devices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some Graphics menu items do not display depending on your device kernel flags and OpenGL capabilities (say what, now).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The menu items that make a difference to playing and enjoying TPA are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Manage Tables</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sound</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mip Mapping</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Detail</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Textures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restore HoF Pts</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="manage_tables"><a class="anchor" href="#manage_tables"></a>2.1. Manage Tables</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This menu is pretty self-explanatory. It lets you do the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock important">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-important" title="Important"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
<code>Update All</code> and <code>Download Owned</code> do not run as background processes. You must have TPA open all the time for this process to complete successfully.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Update All</dt>
<dd>
<p>Update all <em>downloaded</em> tables present on the device that have received RES updates (a term used to indicate a table has received improvements to graphics assets, known as 'resources').</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Download Owned</dt>
<dd>
<p>Bulk download all owned tables <em>missing from the app</em>, that are linked to your Google Play account used to purchase TPA Table Packs or Season Passes.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Delete</dt>
<dd>
<p>By tapping the button to the left of each table in the list, you can delete individual table files.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
The table order in this list is well and truly out of alphabetical order. It is sorted based on the date the table packs were released. That&#8217;s why you see all the older tables from Season 1 and Season 2 appearing first.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are starting from a new device, and you wanted to download and update all owned tables, you would select <code>Download Owned</code>. This will download all tables you own <em>in the order they were released</em>, starting at Season 1.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you already had all the tables on your device, and received an app update through Google Play, you would select <code>Update All</code> to pull down any updates table files.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="managing_tables_outside_the_interface"><a class="anchor" href="#managing_tables_outside_the_interface"></a>2.1.1. Managing Tables Outside the Interface</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is another way to manage tables that allows you to do away with the somewhat awkward menu in TPA. All you need is your favourite Android file browser.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The game Downloadable Content (DLC) is stored in the <code>/sdcard/Android/data/com.farsight.AndroidPinball.javaProject/files/</code> folder.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is arguably easier to navigate to this directory and delete files manually. The method through the UI works, but is slow. Only use it if you are not comfortable deleting files through the file system.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="back_up_your_dlc"><a class="anchor" href="#back_up_your_dlc"></a>2.1.2. Back Up Your DLC</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unless you have a very fast data connection and you live in the United States, I&#8217;d <strong>strongly recommend</strong> you back up your DLC to DropBox, Copy, or even just to a folder on your computer. Just get them off your device. Depending on what Content Delivery Network (CDN) node you connect to, it might take anywhere between 30 minutes to four hours to restore all DLC to your device. Having a local copy synchronised to your device will make restoring faster. Much faster.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And use the new table release each month as a reminder to take a DLC back-up. You&#8217;ll thank yourself later when you need to restore them all.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="sound"><a class="anchor" href="#sound"></a>2.2. Sound</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s not a great deal to this menu: On or Off.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that this turns off <strong>all</strong> sound effects and music. There are no subtle settings to affect mechanical sounds, music, or sound effects. This is most likely to do with limitations of the Farsight Audio Mixer, described later in this guide.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="mip_mapping"><a class="anchor" href="#mip_mapping"></a>2.3. Mip Mapping</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This menu screams "Developer Speak" in an app specifically not targeted at Developers. Another issue is the menu item has been misnamed: it should be <em>Anisotropic Filtering</em>. But try fitting that word into the current UI and you&#8217;ll soon understand why Mip Mapping was chosen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ll need to visit <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mipmap">Wikipedia</a> for a concise description, but what this setting does is affect performance on devices in the area of "depth of field" and the sharpness of the depth of field.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You would think that turning this setting on would be a good thing. But, you need to turn your thinking around when understanding how this works in TPA.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">On</dt>
<dd>
<p>Activates the Mip Mapping function, which serves multiple mipmap images and lets the GPU pick the best sample resolution for your specific device hardware. This is better for devices with limited GPU capabilities.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Off</dt>
<dd>
<p>Deactivates the Mip Mapping function, which serves the highest resolution mipmap. This requires more GPU processing power, and as you can expect, this may add a performance impact for older devices.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The best advice for these two options is experiment with them on your device and see which setting delivers the best performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My suggestion for renaming this to something more user-friendly would be:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sharpness = High</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharpness = Normal</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="detail"><a class="anchor" href="#detail"></a>2.4. Detail</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Detail&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;or High LOD as most regular TPA Andorid forum users refer to it as&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;was implemented <a href="http://pinballarcadefans.com/showthread.php/7358-High-lod-model-beta">mid February 2014</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the device you own, you might not even see this menu. Some Samsung devices featuring the Exynos System on a Chip (SoC) (MALI) architecture did not have a kernel flag set which caused this menu to be hidden. If you don&#8217;t see this menu, your device has a GPU that will probably struggle to run TPA in general.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>High LOD affects what individual elements you see on the table. If you turn this setting to Standard from High, you will really notice the difference. Elements like screw heads, transparencies, plastics, bulbs, even some playfield elements like the curly wires on Bally&#8217;s <em>The Party Zone</em> disappear. All these elements put strain on the GPU to render them, so if your device has a weak GPU this setting will either need to be set to Standard, or may not even be visible to you.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">High</dt>
<dd>
<p>All elements originally present on the table. This is the default for this menu now.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Normal</dt>
<dd>
<p>Less table detail means that certain high-pologon objects are disabled. A performance boost is gained for older devices.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="textures"><a class="anchor" href="#textures"></a>2.5. Textures</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Textures is actually to do with Polygon counts in the models on the Tables. If you set this to the Normal setting, close ups of stand-up targets in Williams' <em>The Machine: Bride of Pinbot</em> appear hexagonal. Set it to High, and they are far less hexagonal featuring about twice the polygon count.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">High</dt>
<dd>
<p>The highest polygon count possible in the table models used in TPA. This is the default for this menu now.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Normal</dt>
<dd>
<p>Hexagonal shaped round targets, and other trade-offs that make some playfield elements appear jaggy at distance, and blocky when zoomed in upon.</p>

<p>You need to keep manually creating backups using Saved Games in case you need to restore. Depending on how much you play TPA will determine how often you create a backup.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a general guideline:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Back up after you achieve a Goal or a High Score in TPA.</p>

<p>Back up no less than weekly if you are a regular TPA player.</p>

<p>There is no way to schedule a Saved Games backup in the game, so you will need to rely on other systems to remind you.

<h3 id="history_of_this_request"><a class="anchor" href="#history_of_this_request"></a>5.5. History of This Request</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The history behind this request being so important was because the game&#8217;s achievements and high scores were all saved in a local database residing in a protected part of the Android Operating System in <code>/data/data/com.farsight.AndroidPinball.javaproject/files/saved_data</code>. This directory could only be accessed by the user if they had unlocked the devices' bootloader and installed a superuser binary (also known as "rooting").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because some device manufacturers classed rooting a device as a warranty breach, users were not inclined to do this just so they could back up their game achievements and data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While GPS is fantastic, there are a few gotchas in how FarSight has implemented the feature: gotchas that will cause data loss if you are not aware of them.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="grouped_achievements_in_gps"><a class="anchor" href="#grouped_achievements_in_gps"></a>5.5.1. Grouped Achievements in GPS</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Achievements are grouped together in GPS because of a limitation in the number of achievements a game can support. This means that for each group of five Standard and Wizard goals, there is one achievement for each category.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To qualify for the GPS achievement, all goals must be achieved before the GPS Achievement is awarded.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="how_tpa_detects_goals"><a class="anchor" href="#how_tpa_detects_goals"></a>5.5.2. How TPA Detects Goals</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember that local database? It is still being used to service the GPS achievements and leaderboard tracking. When the game hooks tell the database that an achievement has been achieved, it adds a flag to the database. When all flags for the Standard achievement group are set, the game triggers GPS to award the associated Achievement.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="understanding_saved_games_in_tpa"><a class="anchor" href="#understanding_saved_games_in_tpa"></a>5.5.3. Understanding Saved Games in TPA</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like most users who use games with GPS implemented, Cloud Save is something that happens automatically. The assumption is that if a game has Cloud Save in the app listing, a user is guaranteed that the app is backing up their scores and achievements to the cloud automatically.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And if they want to play the game on another device, or restore to a new device, the achievements earned to date are restored automatically for them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is <strong>not</strong> how it works in TPA.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="example_online_progress_vs_local_progress"><a class="anchor" href="#example_online_progress_vs_local_progress"></a>5.5.4. Example: Online Progress vs Local Progress</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have earned the GPS "Skilled" or "Wizard" goals online, failing to restore a current Saved Games profile to your device will mean that these goals are not reflected locally.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consider the following scenario:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You have one goal remaining in the "Wizard" GPS achievement for a table (4 out of 5 goals complete),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You un-install TPA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have no Saved Game restore point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You installed TPA fresh again.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this scenario, you would have to start your Wizard Goals again for that table because the local database has no record of the other four goals being achieved. GPS does. TPA does not.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Layering GPS over the <code>saved_games</code> local database is surely the single point of failure for user issues relating to lost data.</p>

<h3 id="why_does_this_happen"><a class="anchor" href="#why_does_this_happen"></a>8.1. Why Does This Happen?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ryan Routon, the former Android developer for TPA, confirmed back in October 2013 in <a href="http://pinballarcadefans.com/showthread.php/6182-Pack-19-Beta?p=108893&amp;viewfull=1#post108893">this post</a> that TPA uses a custom made in-house audio mixer&#8212;&#8203;lets call it FarSight Audio Mixer (FAM)--that is a bit "laggy". It mixes everything into a single channel (yep, no Stereo on any table: even those that originally supported it), which is then sent as a stream to the Java side of the app to be submitted in chunks to the OS.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This lagginess was present well before October 2013 but the reasons causing the issue were not revealed until this date. Advances in device specifications since this date have not resulted in a performance boost to how the FAM operates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Frustratingly, there is no workaround to this issue, unless the mixer is completely rewritten. Lets just say a complete rewrite of the FAM is <strong>highly unlikely</strong> because it is definitely a non-trivial task to re-engineer how the FAM operates across all platforms.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>All information provided by responses from Ryan Routon <a href="http://pinballarcadefans.com/showthread.php/6182-Pack-19-Beta?p=108944&amp;viewfull=1#post108944">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="qlist qanda">
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>What about the flipper sounds: why aren&#8217;t they affected?</em></p>
<p>The flippers don&#8217;t have this problem because these effects are played from a sound pool (using .ogg files directly). Unpack the apk (it&#8217;s basically another name for a zip archive) and you&#8217;ll see them towards the top of the tree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Why not provide all mechanical sounds through the sound pool?</em></p>
<p>Due to the game framework it would be impossible to provide all sounds in a sound pool. All sounds are included in a big byte chunk for each table. Flippers are universal so those are fine to sound pool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>What have you tried to fix the issue?</em></p>
<p>Decrease the audio block size: every time I make the block size smaller to pass to the Stream it breaks some devices and you hear blips in between. Bugs me to no end but not sure what to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Why not make the block size tunable by the user?</em></p>
<p>The block size is device dependent, and is queried automatically by the Android OS for the most optimal block size. Anything smaller than optimal and the audio stream just does not work, which would likely result in force closes because the buffer is trying to read bytes that aren&#8217;t there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>So what is the underlying issue that is causing the headaches?</em></p>
<p>It is actually the streaming aspect that is causing the delay. Even Google admits that the latency issues have been a long-standing issue on Android. They have been improving since ICS, but are still not really quite right.</p>
