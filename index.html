<h2 id="why_this_guide_exists">Why This Guide Exists</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ll be frank: this guide exists because of my frustrations with the User Interface (UI) currently implemented in FarSight Studios' <em>The Pinball Arcade</em> (TPA) for Android. My personal opinion is the UI is limiting, it confuses customers, and offers a poor User Experience (UX) for new users (and even seasoned users familiar with TPA in some cases).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There has been talk of FarSight updating the UI. But they have been saying that for at least a year now, and nothing gets done. The user base swells, but the UX still remains untouched. I&#8217;ve been working around issues caused by the UI for at least that long, and the number of cases I&#8217;ve encountered where customers are just plain confused about features is getting to the point where I have no choice but to take action.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m trying to solve some of these issues by writing this user guide. The guide contains information about features in TPA that can&#8217;t be adequately explained in-game because of a combination of UI limitations and the complexity of the feature.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This guide is not a tool created to disrespect FarSight and their product. Quite the opposite: it is a factual (sometimes raw) testimonial from a customer who happens to be a volunteer beta tester and Technical Writer.  A lot of things in this guide can be figured out by playing around with the UI: some users will be comfortable with this and some won&#8217;t. There are some things that really aren&#8217;t intuitive, and some things that if you assume you know how they work, you may be unpleasantly surprised down the track.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I hope that if you are a new user to TPA Android, this guide helps you get the most out of the app. I hope that if someone at FarSight reads this, they understand the intent and take urgent action to address the workarounds and caveats I&#8217;ve documented in here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So get reading, then get flipping!</p>

<h2 id="Settings_Menu">The Settings Menu Explained</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of User Interface limitations, the Settings menu is a bit of a mess. There are some options that use Developer speak and would be meaningless to many users, yet are very important for configuring optimum performance in Android for older devices. Some menu items don&#8217;t even display depending on your device kernel flags (say what, now).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Read on to learn more about these issues, and how to work around them.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="important_settings_menu_items">Important Settings Menu Items</h3>

<h3 id="manage_tables">Manage Tables</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This menu is pretty self-explanatory. It lets you do the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock important">

<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-important" title="Important"></i>

<td class="content">

<p>Bulk download all owned tables linked to your Google Play account used to purchase TPA Table Packs, or Season Passes.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Delete</dt>
<dd>
<p>There isn&#8217;t a button clearly indicating this, but you can delete individual table files by tapping the button to the left of each table name.</p>

<div class="admonitionblock note">

<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i>

<td class="content">
The table order in this list is well and truly out of alpha order. It is apparently sorted based on the date the table pack was released. That&#8217;s why you see all the older tables from Season 1 and Season 2 appearing first.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="managing_tables_outside_the_interface">Managing Tables Outside the Interface</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is another way to manage tables that allows you to do away with the somewhat awkward menu in TPA. All you need is your favourite Android file browser.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The game Downloadable Content (DLC) is stored in the <code>/sdcard/Android/data/com.farsight.AndroidPinball.javaProject/files/</code> folder.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is arguably easier to navigate to this directory and delete files manually. The method through the UI is fine, but slow. Only use it if you are not comfortable deleting files through the file system.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="back_up_your_dlc">Back Up Your DLC</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unless you have a very fast data connection and you live in the United States, I&#8217;d <strong>strongly recommend</strong> you back up your DLC to DropBox, Copy, or even just to a folder on your computer. Just get them off your device. Depending on what Content Delivery Network (CDN) node you connect to, it might take anywhere between 30 minutes to four hours to restore all DLC to your device. Having a local copy synchronised to your device will make restoring faster. Much faster.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And use the new table release each month as a reminder to take a DLC back-up. You&#8217;ll thank yourself later when you need to restore them all.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="sound">Sound</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s not a great deal to this menu: On or Off.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that this turns off <strong>all</strong> sound effects and music. There are no subtle settings to affect mechanical sounds, music, or sound effects. This is most likely to do with limitations of the Farsight Audio Mixer, described later in this guide.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="mip_mapping">Mip Mapping</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By far, this menu screams "Developer Speak" in an app specifically not targeted at Developers. But the fact is even the menu item has been misnamed: it should be <em>Anisotropic Filtering</em>. But try fitting that word into the current UI and you&#8217;ll soon understand why this menu name was chosen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ll need to visit <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mipmap">Wikipedia</a> for a concise description, but what this setting basically does is affect performance on devices in the area of "depth of field" and the sharpness of the depth of field.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You would think that turning this setting on would be a good thing. But, you need to turn your thinking around when understanding how this works in TPA.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">On</dt>
<dd>
<p>Activates the Mip Mapping function, which serves mutiple mipmap images and lets the GPU pick the best sample resolution for your specific device hardware. This is better for devices with limited GPU capabilities.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Off</dt>
<dd>
<p>Deactivates the Mip Mapping function, which serves the highest resolution mipmap. This requires more GPU processing power, and as you can expect, this add a performance impact for older devices.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So turn it off if you have a next-gen device, but leave it on if you don&#8217;t.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="detail">Detail</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Detail --or High LOD as most regular TPA Andorid forum users refer to it as-- was implemented <a href="http://pinballarcadefans.com/showthread.php/7358-High-lod-model-beta">mid February 2014</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the device you own, you might not even see this menu. Early on in TPA&#8217;s life, some Samsung devices with Exynos System on a Chip (SoC) did not have a kernel flag set which caused this menu to be hidden. If you don&#8217;t see this menu, your device has a GPU that will probably struggle to run TPA in general.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>High LOD affects what individual elements you see on the table. If you turn this setting to Standard from High, you will really notice the difference. Elements like screw heads, transparencies, plastics, bulbs, even some playfield elements like the curly wires on Party Zone disappear. All these elements put strain on the GPU to render them, so if your device has a weak GPU this setting will either need to be set to Standard, or may not even be visible to you.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">High</dt>
<dd>
<p>Get the best possible textures. This is the default for this menu now.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Normal</dt>
<dd>
<p>Less crisp textures, but a performance boost for older devices.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="textures">Textures</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Textures is actually to do with Polygon counts in the models on the Tables. If you set this to the Normal setting, close ups of stand-up targets in <em>The Machine: Bride of Pinbot</em> appear hexagonal. Set it to High, and they are far less hexagonal featuring about twice the polygon count.</p>
</div>

<p>The highest polygon count possible in the table models used in TPA. This is the default for this menu now.</p>

== Configure the Launch Button Position To Suit Your Play Style</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The launch button on tables such as Star Trek: The Next Generation (ST: TNG) and Attack From Mars (AFM) is positioned by default directly under the in-game Pause menu. This is impractical for most users playing TPA using the touchscreen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can reposition this button to your liking, in increments of 5%. This setting caters for your individual preference of launch button position.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The addition of button positions was not well advertised at the time it was implemented, and still remains something that a user needs to stumble across. Particularly as the item is off-screen in the Portrait menu, and three scrolls down in the Landscape menu. This was demonstrated beautifully in Episode 48 of <em>The Pinball Podcast</em>. The hosts tried to work out why the button was where it was and were totally unaware how to change it based on the in-game pause menu on Android.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To work around this issue, ensure that "Show Touch Scheme" is turned on while you are configuring the button position so you can position the launch button where it will not interfere with with a flip or tilt touch zone.</p>

<h2 id="Google_Play_Services">Google Play Services</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Coinciding with the Season 4 release of Earthshaker, a <a href="http://pinballarcadefans.com/showthread.php/7293-Implement-Google-Play-Games-Cloud-Save?highlight=google+play+games">long-standing request</a> (one of many) was finally implemented: Google Play Services support.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The history behind this request being so important was because the game&#8217;s achievements and high scores were all saved in a local database residing in a protected part of the Android Operating System in <code>/data/data/com.farsight.AndroidPinball.javaproject/files/saved_data</code>. This directory could only be accessed by the user if they had unlocked the devices' bootloader and installed a superuser binary (also known as "rooting").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because some device manufacturers classed rooting a device as a warranty breach, users were not inclined to do this just so they could back up their game achievements and data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While GPS is fantastic, there are a few gotchas in how FarSight has implemented the feature: gotchas that will cause data loss if you are not aware of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="achievements_in_gps">Achievements in GPS</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Achievements are grouped together in GPS because of a limitation in the number of achievements a game can support. This means that for each group of five Standard and Wizard goals, there is one achievement for each category.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To qualify for the GPS achievement, all goals must be achieved before the GPS Achievement is awarded.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="implementation">Implementation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember that local database? Yep, it is still being used to service the GPS achievements and leaderboard tracking. When the game hooks tell the database that an achievement has been achieved, it adds a flag to the database. When all flags for the Standard achievement group are set, the game triggers GPS to award the associated Achievement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This continuing use of the <code>saved_games</code> local database is the single point of failure for user issues relating to lost data, as you&#8217;ll discover later in this section.</p>

If you do not create a Saved Games restore point manually, <strong>all</strong> local achievements (Standard/Wizard Goals, or Local High Scores) will be lost  if you un-install or re-install TPA on the same&#8212;&#8203;or other&#8212;&#8203;device.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like most users who use games with GPS implemented, Cloud Save is something that happens automatically. The assumption is that if a game has Cloud Save in the app listing, a user is guaranteed that the app is backing up their scores and achievements to the cloud automatically.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And if they want to play the game on another device, or restore to a new device, the achievements earned to date are restored automatically for them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is <strong>not</strong> how it works in TPA.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Until this user guide existed, there was no documentation about how Saved Games worked for the general user of TPA. For those folks not pouring over Pinball Arcade Fans Forums to learn how to use the app, users had no idea they had to create a manual restore point using Saved Games.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even if you have earned the GPS "Skilled" or "Wizard" goals online, failing to restore a current Saved Games profile to your device will mean that these goals are not reflected locally.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consider the following scenario:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Have one goal remaining in the "Wizard" GPS achievement for a table (4 out of 5 goals complete),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Un-install TPA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have no Saved Game restore point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Installed TPA again.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this scenario, you would have to start your Wizard Goals again for that table because the local database has no record of the other four goals being achieved. GPS does. TPA does not.</p>

<p>You need to keep manually creating backups using Saved Games in case you need to restore. Depending on how much you play TPA will determine how often you create a backup.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a general guideline:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Back up after you achieve a Goal or a High Score in TPA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back up no less than weekly if you are a regular TPA player.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back up no less that monthly if you are a casual player.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is no way to schedule a Saved Games backup in the game, so you will need to rely on other systems to remind you. I set a Calendar reminder to back up each month, which is a workaround until a better way of managing this important data-retention activity is implemented.<br>
