<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of User Interface limitations, the Settings menu is a bit of a mess. There are some options that use Developer speak and would be meaningless to many users, yet are very important for configuring optimum performance in Android for older devices. Some menu items don&#8217;t even display depending on your device kernel flags (say what, now).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Read on to learn more about these issues, and how to work around them.</p>

<p>This menu is pretty self-explanatory. It lets you do the following:</p>

The table order in this list is well and truly out of alpha order. It is apparently sorted based on the date the table pack was released. That&#8217;s why you see all the older tables from Season 1 and Season 2 appearing first.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="managing_tables_outside_the_interface">Managing Tables Outside the Interface</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is another way to manage tables that allows you to do away with the somewhat awkward menu in TPA. All you need is your favourite Android file browser.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The game Downloadable Content (DLC) is stored in the <code>/sdcard/Android/data/com.farsight.AndroidPinball.javaProject/files/</code> folder.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is arguably easier to navigate to this directory and delete files manually. The method through the UI is fine, but slow. Only use it if you are not comfortable deleting files through the file system.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="back_up_your_dlc">Back Up Your DLC</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unless you have a very fast data connection and you live in the United States, I&#8217;d <strong>strongly recommend</strong> you back up your DLC to DropBox, Copy, or even just to a folder on your computer. Just get them off your device. Depending on what Content Delivery Network (CDN) node you connect to, it might take anywhere between 30 minutes to four hours to restore all DLC to your device. Having a local copy synchronised to your device will make restoring faster. Much faster.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And use the new table release each month as a reminder to take a DLC back-up. You&#8217;ll thank yourself later when you need to restore them all.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="sound">Sound</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s not a great deal to this menu: On or Off.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that this turns off <strong>all</strong> sound effects and music. There are no subtle settings to affect mechanical sounds, music, or sound effects. This is most likely to do with limitations of the Farsight Audio Mixer, described later in this guide.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="mip_mapping">Mip Mapping</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By far, this menu screams "Developer Speak" in an app specifically not targeted at Developers. But the fact is even the menu item has been misnamed: it should be <em>Anisotropic Filtering</em>. But try fitting that word into the current UI and you&#8217;ll soon understand why this menu name was chosen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ll need to visit <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mipmap">Wikipedia</a> for a concise description, but what this setting basically does is affect performance on devices in the area of "depth of field" and the sharpness of the depth of field.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You would think that turning this setting on would be a good thing. But, you need to turn your thinking around when understanding how this works in TPA.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">On</dt>
<dd>
<p>Activates the Mip Mapping function, which serves mutiple mipmap images and lets the GPU pick the best sample resolution for your specific device hardware. This is better for devices with limited GPU capabilities.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Off</dt>
<dd>
<p>Deactivates the Mip Mapping function, which serves the highest resolution mipmap. This requires more GPU processing power, and as you can expect, this add a performance impact for older devices.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So turn it off if you have a next-gen device, but leave it on if you don&#8217;t.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="detail">Detail</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Detail --or High LOD as most regular TPA Andorid forum users refer to it as-- was implemented <a href="http://pinballarcadefans.com/showthread.php/7358-High-lod-model-beta">mid February 2014</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the device you own, you might not even see this menu. Early on in TPA&#8217;s life, some Samsung devices with Exynos System on a Chip (SoC) did not have a kernel flag set which caused this menu to be hidden. If you don&#8217;t see this menu, your device has a GPU that will probably struggle to run TPA in general.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>High LOD affects what individual elements you see on the table. If you turn this setting to Standard from High, you will really notice the difference. Elements like screw heads, transparencies, plastics, bulbs, even some playfield elements like the curly wires on Party Zone disappear. All these elements put strain on the GPU to render them, so if your device has a weak GPU this setting will either need to be set to Standard, or may not even be visible to you.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">High</dt>
<dd>
<p>Get the best possible textures. This is the default for this menu now.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Normal</dt>
<dd>
<p>Less crisp textures, but a performance boost for older devices.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="textures">Textures</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Textures is actually to do with Polygon counts in the models on the Tables. If you set this to the Normal setting, close ups of stand-up targets in <em>The Machine: Bride of Pinbot</em> appear hexagonal. Set it to High, and they are far less hexagonal featuring about twice the polygon count.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">High</dt>
<dd>
<p>The highest polygon count possible in the table models used in TPA. This is the default for this menu now.</p>

<p>Hexagonal shaped round targets, and other trade-offs that make some playfield elements appear jaggy at distance, and blocky when zoomed in upon.</p>

<p>The rest of these options really belong in another menu. I&#8217;ve suggested this in <a href="http://pinballarcadefans.com/showthread.php/9603-Improve-the-Settings-Menu">this thread</a> but at the time of writing the issue has not been publicly acknowledged.</p>

== Configure the Launch Button Position To Suit Your Play Style</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The launch button on tables such as Star Trek: The Next Generation (ST: TNG) and Attack From Mars (AFM) is positioned by default directly under the in-game Pause menu. This is impractical for most users playing TPA using the touchscreen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can reposition this button to your liking, in increments of 5%. This setting caters for your individual preference of launch button position.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The addition of button positions was not well advertised at the time it was implemented, and still remains something that a user needs to stumble across. Particularly as the item is off-screen in the Portrait menu, and three scrolls down in the Landscape menu. This was demonstrated beautifully in Episode 48 of <em>The Pinball Podcast</em>. The hosts tried to work out why the button was where it was and were totally unaware how to change it based on the in-game pause menu on Android.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="adjusting_the_launch_button_position">Adjusting the Launch Button Position</h3>
<div class="admonitionblock warning">

<tr>
<td class="icon">

The launch button has priority over all flipper touch zones and tilt touch zones. Be very careful where you place it because if it is placed over any of the touch zones, that touch zone will not work properly.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To work around this issue, ensure that "Show Touch Scheme" is turned on while you are configuring the button position so you can position the launch button where it will not interfere with with a flip or tilt touch zone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may need to experiment with the different options until you find one that works for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
